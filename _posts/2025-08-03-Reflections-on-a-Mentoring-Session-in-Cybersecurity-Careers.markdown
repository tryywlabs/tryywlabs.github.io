Earlier today, I had the chance to sit down for a focused 2-hour mentoring session about breaking into early careers in cybersecurity, especially in the context of working abroad.

The mentor was an experienced professional in offensive security (penetration testing and red teaming), and is teaching the [BHPT course](https://www.inflearn.com/en/course/%ED%98%B8%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8-%EA%B8%B0%EB%B0%98-%EB%AA%A8%EC%9D%98%ED%95%B4%ED%82%B9-%EA%B8%B0%EC%B4%88) in single-host penetration testing that I am currently taking online.

It turned out to be an eye-openning conversation, touching on everything from visas and entry points into the field, to realistic strategies for landing an offensive security role.

Here's the summary of the most important lessons I took away.

### On International Careers: Visas, Language, and Hiring Reality
One of my initial concerns was whether my visa situation woould limit my ability to work overseas. Thankfully, I learned that for many countries, switching from a student visa to a graduate visa is usually enough to qualify for entry-level roles. Being part of a graduate degree in the UK, this is not a major barrier in my case.

Language was another topic. As anywhere else, being proficient in English and able to work without any language barriers is a must-have skill, coming before any technical capabilities (again, not an overhead for me). It was reassuring to hear that in cybersecurity, especially in offensive roles, there's openness to hiring international talent. As long as you have the skills and can communicate effectively, you're good to go.

There doesn't seem to be much risk of my application dismissed due to paperwork or nationality alone.

### Why Entry-Level Pentesting Jobs are Rare
We also talked about why it's difficult to find any true entry-level positions in offensive security. It turns out that the nature of pentesting work makes it *difficult to have the traditional junior-senior dynamic*, where the junior is given the opportunity to grow, ask questions and make mistakes while shadowing their senior. Every project is different, and there's rarely room for someone to "shadow" an experienced tester, as only one tester is allocated per project.

Instead, new hires are often expected to take on full projects from day one, which is a risky proposition for a company. That's why many people start in SOC roles, where the scope is more structured. From there, they can gain practical experience, pursue certificationas, gain over-the-shoulder insights into offensive security, eventually transitioning into pentesting roles either internally or by being scouted.

### A Realistic Roadmap to Offensive Security
A recurring theme throughout the session was to build toward an offensive security career in a practical and sustainable way. Here's the general route:
1. Apply to cybersecurity service providers, not just tech companies with security teams.
2. Start in a SOC analyst role. It's often the most accessible point of entry.
3. Earn certifications like OSCP while working, work on personal blog posts and build a foundation for the transition.
4. Position yourself for internal transfers into OFFSEC rols or get scouted elsewhere.
It seems like a long route, but it's one that's grounded in how companies actually operate.

Interestingly, larger companies may not be the best places to learn offensive skills from early on. Because the roles are so specialised, SOC analysts in big firms often only do alert monitoring, while security projects with learning value are given to other specialists or outsourced. They may be a good brand name for your CV, but not necessarily a place to grow fast as a security practitioner.

### Feedback on my CV and Blog
I also received some great feedback on how to improve my CV and personal blog. The biggest point was focus: tailor my profile overview to the specific roles that I am aiming for.

Some keywords I should include and highlight where:
- Penetration Testing
- Offensive Security
- GDPR
- SIEM

Each experience should highlight skills and outcomes in a *keyword-based* format. For example, instead of saying "I build automation tools", I need to clarify the *kind of automation*, *tools used*, and *what the result was*.

Projects also matter; even if they're just from self-study or coursework, they need to be published somewhere. My blog should reflect that I'm actively learning, experimenting, and documenting my geekiing-out journey. This creates visible proof of momentum, not just spoken potential (as we always say, *Show*, *don't Tell*).

### Writing About What I’m Thinking

One of the best pieces of advice I received was to write more; not just about projects, but also about the questions and doubts I wrestle with while learning cybersecurity. If something is confusing, and I dig into it to understand, that’s worth sharing. It shows initiative and curiosity, and it contributes to the community.

### Remote Opportunities

We also discussed the possibility of remote roles. Companies like CrowdStrike do hire internationally, even from regions like South Korea. Other roles, such as penetration testing and CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence), are often remote-friendly as long as you bring value and communicate clearly.

Some companies, like Microsoft Korea, mostly hire for sales roles rather than technical positions. This means that even if you’re based in Korea, you should look for global or remote openings that allow you to do meaningful technical work.

### The Value of Home Labs (and Their Limits)

We talked a bit about home labs, which I’ve been using to build skills. They’re a great way to learn, but they also have limits especially around scale and realism. It’s important to be able to say, “I’ve been practicing this on my own, but I want a team environment where I can go further.”

That’s something I want to emphasize when I apply: I’m not just interested in security, I love it. I want to geek out, experiment, and grow in an environment that feeds that passion.

### Final Reflections

All in all, the session was incredibly motivating. It gave me a clearer view of the field, and most importantly, a strategy I can start applying right now. There’s no magic shortcut into offensive security but there is a path, and it’s one I’m excited to walk.
