This Post has been created to share my projects and study material, which I couldn’t all explain in my CVs and interviews.

I am currently a masters student in Software Development at the University of Glasgow.

My passion is in cyber security. As someone just starting out in this field, I’m interested in all domains of cyber security: blue teaming, thread detection, offensive security, CTFs, and even OPSEC! The ultimate goal for the forseable future is to land a security role either as a penetration tester, and get a chance to contribute to the security domain. To achieve this, I’m taking a course in Basic Host-based Penetration Testing by Red Racoon and working my way to achieve the OSCP certification.

I’m actively seeking opportunities in the UK related to cyber security. Please feel free to browse around my blog and see if I might be someone you’re looking for as an employer (or simply to connect with)!

Thanks for your visit :D
